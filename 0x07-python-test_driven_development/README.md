## Background Context
### Important notice on intranet checks for Python projects
Starting from today:

- Based on the requirements of each task, you should always write the documentation (module(s) + function(s)) and tests first, before you actually code anything-
- The intranet checks for Python projects won’t be released before their first deadline, in order for you to focus more on TDD and think about all possible cases
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case. But not in the implementation of them!
- Don’t trust the user, always think about all possible edge cases
## Resources
Read or watch:

- doctest — Test interactive Python examples (until “26.2.3.7. Warnings” included)
- doctest – Testing through documentation
- Unit Tests in Python
## Learning Objectives
- At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General
- Why Python programming is awesome
- What’s an interactive test
- Why tests are important
- How to write Docstrings to create tests
- How to write documentation for each module and function
- What are the basic option flags to create tests
- How to find edge cases
## Copyright - Plagiarism
- You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.
- You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.
- You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
- Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.
